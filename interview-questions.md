# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Git is a tool and command that's used to push and pull data to and from GitHub. GitHub is a repository that is used to store new code and retrieve saved code.

  Researched answer: Git is the free and open source distributed version control system that's responsible for everything GitHub related that occurs locally on your computer. Software developers use Git commands as a way to easily share and combine code. GitHub, on the other hand, is a website and cloud-based service that allows developers to store and manage their code as well as track and control changes to their code.



2. What types of evaluations will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: TRUE or FALSE evaluations will return a Boolean value.

  Researched answer: A Boolean value is a data type that can only have one of two values; e.g, True/False. You can use the Boolean function to evaluate whether an expression is true or false.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is a location within an array. The difference between an index an a value is that an index is a location that's used to store values.

  Researched answer: An array is a unique variable capable of holding more than one value at a time. These values are held in a location that's referred to as an index. In an array, the first value is stored at index location 0. The difference between an index and a value is that the index refers to a location while the value refers to the actual value of the data being stored.



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: Iteration is repeating a process over and over again. A good example of iteration is the use of a for loop.

  Researched answer: An iterator is an object used to define a sequence and perform repetitive tasks. An example of iteration would be using a for loop to iterate through an array. Iteration is useful when you want to execute a function multiple times using different sets of inputs each time.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Pair programming is a technique that's used to encourage developers to work in teams to solve complex programming challenges. When using pair programming, you're likely to have a driver and navigator role. The driver is the person actively coding while the navigator assists by providing helpful information and helping the driver talk through the problem

  Researched answer: Pair programming is an agile software development technique that allows developers to work together using a single computer. There are typically two designated roles; one being the driver and the other being the navigator. The driver is the developer on the keyboard while the navigator is more so focused on the overall direction of the code. When using this technique, it is expected that the individuals will occasionally alternate roles to keep ideas fresh.



6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: I learned a lot from being able to work through some of the challenges provided with a classmate using pair programming techniques. Being able to see how others work through the problems helped me gain a better understanding of the fundamentals we discussed this week. The most beneficial part of pair programming, for me, was being able to practice Git commands by creating branches and pushing and pulling data to and from GitHub.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. GitHub pull request: A pull request is used to propose and collaborate on changes to a repository. It's important to perform these changes on a branch to make sure the main branch only includes finished and approved work.

2. Higher Order Functions: A higher-order function is a function that either takes a function as an argument or returns a function.

3. Jest: Jest is a JavaScript test runner that's used for creating, running, and structuring tests. Jest testing checks to ensure the code meets expectations.

4. Objects: Objects are variables. The primary difference is that a variable holds one value while an object is capable of holding multiple values.

5. Classes: Classes are special functions used to allow the creation of constructors and prototype-based inheritance.
